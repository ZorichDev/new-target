        <h1>What Is Landscape Photography?</h1>
        <p>Landscape photography is the technique of capturing images of nature to bring your viewer into the scene. Through landscape photography, the photographers demonstrate their connection to nature and capture the essence of the environment around them.
            When we see a landscape, our eyes travel over it and focus on the appealing elements. Our field of vision includes a great deal of the scenes, but eyes and brains can ignore everything except the fascinating details. Lenses and sensors or film cannot do this by themselves.

                <p>
                    <h4>Flowing Water</h4>
Think about the character of a river or stream and how you will convey that character in the image. For example, a big, slow river is different from a fast-moving mountain stream in looks and feelings. The water is the center of interest in the photograph. It can be an element in your composition as diagonal or other leading lines, horizontal lines, or shapes complementing other frame features.
 
You can also use the reflections in the water. For instance, you can use some reflections to intensify the image, such as the colors of reflected autumn leaves. Other reflections can be distracting. You can move around to include or eliminate those reflections or try again when the sun is at a different angle. Try using a polarizing filter to reduce some of the reflection and increase contrast.
<h4>Forests</h4>
Like water, think about the character and the feeling of the forest you want to communicate in your photograph. Woods can either be dark and brooding or light and airy, including some unique features that will help express the feeling. Find the point of interest, such as a slightly different tree trunk, a path winding through, or a colorful flowering vine. Compose the point of interest to lead the viewer to it. For example, look for beams of light entering the canopy or a particular spot on the forest floor directly lit by the sun.
 
Whether shooting from inside a forest or towards it, watch for patterns, lines, and other elements. You can try both wide and telephoto lenses. A wide lens makes the trees soar while looking up at the trees, whereas a telephoto compresses a row of trunks. You can lie down and look straight up through the branches or climb a tree to look down the path.
Plains And Prairies
Plains and prairies are among the most challenging landscapes to photograph well because of the lack of point of interest in these wide-open spaces. In most cases, the huge scope is one of the things you are communicating. However, viewers need something to focus on. So, find a unique element and use it as a point of interest that conveys the scene and a sense of scale. Try to use every available element, such as a winding road, a stream, or a fence line, to lead viewers into the image.
 
Identify an angle and composition to reflect the personality of the plain. For instance, a clear blue sky might reflect the character of one plane while a brewing storm reflects another plain’s personality. However, follow the rule of thirds. If the sky is necessary, set the horizon along with the frame’s bottom third division. If not, place it along with the upper third.
<h4>Deserts</h4>
You can show the rugged nature and the beauty of deserts. You can capture heat waves in the afternoon using a long lens to compress them and get dramatic shots. Deserts are great for pictures of stars as there is no humidity and terrestrial lights to interfere. So, stars seem numerous and brilliant in the desert. Sand color changes throughout the day when the angle of the sun changes. A wide shot will best portray a desert, and a closeup of a plant struggling for survival on the side of a dune might best represent another.
 
You can include the sun in the image to convey the hot and harsh atmosphere of the desert. However, the bright sun might underexpose of other elements in the frame. So instead, you can shoot in manual mode, take a reading without the sun in the frame, and reduce the shutter button halfway to hold the exposure and reframe before shooting.
Suppose you are shooting film, bracket a lot, and ensure to get the exposure you need. While using a digital camera, check the images when you are shooting. Wide-angle lenses are suitable as the blown-out sun takes up less space, but lens flare can appear. If it is windy in the desert, be cautious to protect your camera and lenses from the blowing sand. Avoid opening the camera back if you are not in a well-sheltered area.
